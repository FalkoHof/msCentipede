# msCentipede

**msCentipede** is an algorithm for accurately inferring transcription factor binding sites using chromatin
accessibility data (Dnase-seq, ATAC-seq) and is written in Python2.x. 
The hierarchical multiscale model underlying msCentipede identifies factor-bound genomic sites
by using patterns in DNA cleavage resulting from the action of nucleases in open chromatin regions 
(regions typically bound by transcription factors). msCentipede, 
a generalization of the [CENTIPEDE](http://centipede.uchicago.edu) model, accounts for 
heterogeneity in the DNA cleavage patterns around sites bound by transcription factors.

This repo contains set of scripts to load the data and run the algorithm. This document summarizes 
how to download and setup this software package and provides instructions on how to run the software
on a test dataset of motif instances and some publicly available DNase-seq data.

## Dependencies

msCentipede depends on 
+ [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
+ [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
+ [Cvxopt](http://www.cvxopt.org/)
+ [Pysam](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam)

A number of python distributions already have the first two modules packaged in them. It is also
straightforward to install all these dependencies 
 (1) using package managers for MACOSX and several Linux distributions,
 (2) from platform-specific binary packages, and
 (3) directly from source

We will now describe in detail how to use this software using an example dataset of CTCF motif instances on chromosome 10 in hg19 coordinates is provided in `test/CTCF_chr10_motifs.txt.gz`. DNase-seq data for the GM12878 cell line (bam and bai files) can be downloaded from ENCODE to `test/` (in the following instructions, we assume the data files are named [Gm12878_Rep1.bam]() and [Gm12878_Rep2.bam]())

The software is designed to run in two separate steps. In the first step, optimal values for the model parameters are estimated using a subset of all motif instances. In the second step, posterior probability of factor binding is inferred for all motif instances. Since accurate estimates of model parameters can be obtained using 5000-10000 motif instances, this enables efficient inference for those transcription factors that have orders of magnitude more motif instances genomewide. If more motif instances are available in the file than the value of the flag `--batch`, then `batch` number of motif instances that have the highest PWM score are used in learning model parameters.

### Key Inputs

The key inputs that need to be passed to this script are 
+   a path to the file containing the list of motif instances
+   the bam files (sorted and indexed) containing sequencing reads from a chromatin accessibility assay (DNase-seq or ATAC-seq). 

    *Note: these inputs are positional arguments and the files must be specified in the correct order (as shown above).* 

When multiple library / sample replicates are available, the bam files for the replicates can be provided as separate files, separated by whitespace. Bam files containing single-end reads and paired-end reads can be mixed since msCentipede currently does not model the fragment size distribution. However, bam files from different protocols or drastically different read lengths are best not mixed since protocol or read length differences could mask biologically meaningful heterogeneity that is relevant in identifying transcription factor binding sites.

### Learning model parameters

The model parameters can be learned by passing the following flags.

    python call_binding.py --task learn test/CTCF_chr10_motifs.txt.gz test/Gm12878_Rep1.bam test/Gm12878_Rep2.bam

This will run msCentipede with all other default values and output a log file `test/CTCF_chr10_motifs_msCentipede_log.txt` and a file `test/CTCF_chr10_motifs_msCentipede_model_parameters.pkl` in which the model parameter objects are stored. This is a standard pickle file that can be viewed using the `cPickle` module.

### Inferring factor binding

The posterior log odds of binding for a set of motif instances can be computed by passing the following flags.

    python call_binding.py --task infer test/CTCF_chr10_motifs.txt.gz test/Gm12878_Rep1.bam test/Gm12878_Rep2.bam

This will run msCentipede with all other default values and output a file `test/CTCF_chr10_motifs_msCentipede_binding_posterior.txt.gz`.

### Optional parameters

Instead of the default file names, you can specify the file name to which the run log, model parameters and binding posterior odds will be written, using the flags `--log_file`, `--model_file` and `--posterior_file`, respectively.

If the model flag is specified to be `msCentipede-flexbgmean` or `msCentipede-flexbg`, then a path to a bam file containing chromatin accessibility data from genomic DNA must be passed, using the flag `--bam_file_genomicdna`.
